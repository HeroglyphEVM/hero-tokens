# Heroglyph: The Game

The game is a system build on top of [Heroglyph Protocol](https://github.com/HeroglyphEVM/heroglyph) using the [Heroglyph-Library](https://github.com/HeroglyphEVM/heroglyph-library). 


## How it works
We have multiple phases in our game. As of the date of this Readme, we had Phase 1 & 2 going live

**Phase 1: Unknown NFT Minting** - People had the possibility of minting Genesis Keys

**Phase 2: Unleash The Protocol** - We put the protocol live, connecting everything and deploying 15 tokens, in which each can be minted by ETH-Validator if they had in their possession the token's genesis key

## Showcase
The game is a legitimate project and also showcases what people can do with Heroglyph Protocol. Anyone could have created this type of game if they wanted to.

- Developers can draw inspiration from this to build their own products with Heroglyph.
- Users gain a better understanding of how to utilize Heroglyph and how they can customize their usage to achieve the best possible results.

*Note: LayerZero is optional, you can build your system without it*
